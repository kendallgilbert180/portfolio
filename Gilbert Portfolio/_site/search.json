    "text": ",,\nHi! My name is Kendall Gilbert and I am first year student in the Data Science and Analytics program at Georgetown University. I recently graduated in May from Elon University where I majored in Media Analytics with minors in Statistics and Business Administration. As a media analytics major, I learned about analyzing, visualing and making sense of media data. A few relevant courses from this program included:\n\nCommunicating Media Insights\nApplied Media Analytics\nMeasuring Media Impact\n\nYou can learn more about my undergraduate major here! Junior year, in my Applied Media Analytics class I was introduced to R for the first time ever. This is where I fell in love with the idea of data analysis and data visualization. You can access my portfolio for this class here!\nFurthermore, my statistics and business classes provided a basic foundation for my transition into the data science world. A few key classes I completed for these minors included:\n\nSurvey Sampling Methods\nStatistical Modeling\nStatistics in Application\n\nTo further prepare for Georgetown’s DSAN Program I took Introduction to Computer Science, Calculus and Multi-Variable Calculus in order to prepare for my transition.\nI am originally from Narragansett Rhode Island but I have lived in California and Colorado as well. In my free time I like to spend time outdoors, hang out with my dogs and travel.\nLiving by the water in Narragansett, I am passionate about preserving our oceans and ensuring their sustainability. This is a major reason why I chose to complete this semester long project on ocean sustainability.\nYou can learn more about me on my Linkedin! Click here!"

The main objective of this project was to answer questions like:\n\nWhat is the Importance of Ocean Sustainability?\nWhat Negative Impacts Do Humans Have on Ocean Sustainability?\nWhat Is Currently Being Done for Ocean Sustainability?\n\nI utilized machine learning techniques such as naive bayes, dimensionality reduction, clustering and decision trees while compelting this project.\nPortfolio\nSkills: Python, R-Studio, Scikit Learn, Pandas, Machine Learning, EDA\n\nTitle: Energy Behavior and Patterns of Prosumers  Class: DSAN5300 - Statistical Learning for Modeling and Analysis  Description: This project seeks to use statistical and machine learning tools to identify if there is a trend in prosumer consumption based on power production, current weather patterns, the price of both renewable and non-renewable energy, location, and time of day. Because businesses also use energy differently than households, we also attempted to classify if a given prosumer was a business or household based on their installed solar capacity, location, and net energy consumption vs production pattern.\nResearch Poster  Report\nSkills: Python, R-Studio, Linear / Logistic Regression, LDA / QDA, Neural Networks, Statistical Analysis\nTitle: Mastering CRM and Data Structures  Class: DSAN5500 Data Structures, Objects and Analysis Description: This project provided the opportunity to master my proficiency in data structures, specifically linked lists, and think outside the box when it comes to data structures in specific industries. It is beneficial to take a step back from the computer science and bridge the technical work with how it can help a company, and this exploration allowed us to do so.\nProject\nSkills: Python, Object Oriented Program, Data Structures"
