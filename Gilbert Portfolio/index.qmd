## About Me!

Hi! My name is Kendall Gilbert and I am first year student in the Data Science and Analytics program at Georgetown University. I recently graduated in May from Elon University where I majored in Media Analytics with minors in Statistics and Business Administration. As a media analytics major, I learned about analyzing, visualing and making sense of media data. A few relevant courses from this program included:

- Communicating Media Insights

- Applied Media Analytics

- Measuring Media Impact

You can learn more about my undergraduate major [here!](https://www.elon.edu/u/academics/communications/academics/media-analytics-major/) Junior year, in my Applied Media Analytics class I was introduced to R for the first time ever. This is where I fell in love with the idea of data analysis and data visualization. You can access my portfolio for this class [here!](https://rpubs.com/KendallGilbert)

Furthermore, my statistics and business classes provided a basic foundation for my transition into the data science world. A few key classes I completed for these minors included:

- Survey Sampling Methods 

- Statistical Modeling 

- Statistics in Application

To further prepare for Georgetown's DSAN Program I took Introduction to Computer Science, Calculus and Multi-Variable Calculus in order to prepare for my transition. 

 I am originally from Narragansett Rhode Island but I have lived in California and Colorado as well. In my free time I like to spend time outdoors, hang out with my dogs and travel.

 Living by the water in Narragansett, I am passionate about preserving our oceans and ensuring their sustainability. This is a major reason why I chose to complete this semester long project on ocean sustainability.
